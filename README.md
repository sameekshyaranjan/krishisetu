# 🌱 KrishiSetu

KrishiSetu is a comprehensive MERN-stack Agri-Marketplace designed to directly connect farmers with verified traders. The platform aims to eliminate middlemen, provide real-time price intelligence, and facilitate secure negotiations for agricultural commodities.

*Note: This project is currently under active development. The backend database architecture is complete, and API endpoints are actively being built.*

## 🚀 Features (Planned & In-Progress)
- **Role-Based Workflows:** Separate dashboards for Farmers, Traders, and System Admins.
- **Direct Crop Bidding:** Real-time negotiation engine between farmers and buyers.
- **Trust & KYC System:** Verification statuses for traders and a dual-sided rating/review system.
- **Communication Hub:** Contextual in-app messaging and notification alerts.
- **Government Schemes:** Informational directory for farmers to access subsidies and resources.
- **Secure Authentication:** OTP-based login for rural accessibility, paired with JWT security.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose (ODM)
- **Authentication:** JWT (jsonwebtoken), Twilio SMS *(Upcoming)*
- **Frontend:** React.js *(Upcoming)*
- **Real-Time:** Socket.io *(Upcoming)*

## 📂 Backend Architecture
The backend follows a strict MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure to separate business logic, routing, and database interactions.

```

## 🏗️ Database Models Built (Phase 1)
The application leverages advanced NoSQL concepts including **Polymorphic References (`refPath`)**, **TTL Indexes**, and **Compound Indexes** across the following models:

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Admin` | Platform administrators (Email/Password Auth) |
| `Farmer` | Sellers listing crops (Mobile OTP Auth) |
| `Trader` | Verified buyers placing bids (Mobile OTP Auth) |
| `Crop` | Inventory listings linked to Farmers |
| `Bid` | Negotiation records between Traders and Farmers |
| `OTP` | Self-destructing secure tokens (MongoDB TTL) |
| `Transaction` | Payment tracking for completed deals |
| `MandiPrice` | Wholesale market prices from government APIs |
| `Message` | Chat system with double polymorphic references |
| `Notification` | Event-driven inbox system |
| `Report` | Trust & Safety moderation workflow |
| `Review` | Reputation rating system with compound index spam prevention |
| `Scheme` | Government scheme directory for farmer awareness |
| `AuditLog` | Platform activity logging for admin accountability |

## 🔐 Middleware
- **Auth Middleware (`protect`):** Validates JWT Bearer tokens on protected routes, attaches decoded user payload to `req.user`, and returns `401 Unauthorized` for missing or invalid tokens.

## 💻 Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sameekshyaranjan/krishisetu.git
   cd krishisetu/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your details:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   *You will need a MongoDB Atlas connection string.*

4. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.
